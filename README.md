- 👋 Hi, I’m @LEVELzLORD
- 👀 I'm in the process of creating the goals the player wants to achieve and the rules the player will follow in their decision making process. Roughly speaking, I'm a game designer)
- 🌱 At the moment, I am learning to code in order to track the creation of the game I conceived at every stage. A programmer in the gaming industry is the person (people) who breathes life into the project, makes it come to life. I respect these people, their work is very cumbersome and complex, it also requires inhuman concentration. Therefore, I want to learn how to understand computer code in order to be closer to the project that my team and I are creating.


- 💞️ Creating games is not the work of one person, but of the whole team. All without exception: designers, artists, modelers, programmers, animators, directors, screenwriters, actors. All of them are parents, and what kind of “baby” will turn out depends entirely on the work of both the team as a whole and each individual. I am looking for partnerships with professionals who love their job, those who love the industry, who are in solidarity with their colleagues and can prompt and direct on the right path)
- 📫 if you want to collaborate and participate in interesting projects that can change the understanding of video games both in art and in business. Email me: prostoleto03@gmail.com
